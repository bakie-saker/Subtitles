3
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,450
STOP. STOP.

4
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,791
Why...

5
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,003
did you spare my life?

6
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,430
Gabriel...

7
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,849
Where is he?

8
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,250
I want him dead.

9
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,296
What is it?

10
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,548
It's how he spoke to it.

11
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,323
It will change you.

12
00:56:58,499 --> 00:56:59,959
We must make a choice.

13
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,710
And the Russians
have nothing to lose.

14
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,759
The coordinates.

15
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:19,469
Be careful.

16
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,392
I love you.

17
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,145
I will see you again.

18
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,114
Go with them.

19
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,656
He's sending the coordinates.

20
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,909
Our people are listening.

21
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,495
The roof is collapsing. Get out.

22
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:17,333
How do we kill it?

23
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,111
But...

24
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:48,739
...there's always a but.

25
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,026
Good luck.

26
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:35,664
Gabriel is down there.

27
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:37,791
Let me come with you.

28
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:40,544
His time will come.

29
02:12:14,052 --> 02:12:16,763
Who will live
and who will die?

30
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:28,024
I will see you again.

31
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:56,047
I kill people.

32
02:15:04,847 --> 02:15:06,015
You have to operate on me.

33
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:12,104
Close it tight.

34
02:15:12,313 --> 02:15:13,147
A bandage.

35
02:15:13,523 --> 02:15:14,482
A bandage please.

36
02:16:17,879 --> 02:16:20,756
My clavicle... count down to my second rib.

37
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:23,634
Now...

38
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,720
...make an incision.

39
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:34,437
Hold this.

40
02:16:38,524 --> 02:16:39,567
It's going to be OK.

41
02:16:41,193 --> 02:16:42,695
Bottoms up.

42
02:16:49,452 --> 02:16:50,410
Now what?

43
02:16:50,411 --> 02:16:51,494
Pen... in the bag.

44
02:16:51,495 --> 02:16:52,496
Pressure.

45
02:16:53,164 --> 02:16:54,582
Take it apart.

46
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:02,340
Now what?

47
02:17:16,312 --> 02:17:17,647
Thank you.

48
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:37,798
The blink of an eye.
