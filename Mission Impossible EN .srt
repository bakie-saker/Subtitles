Did Ethan fail to mention her?

237
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,839
A fellow named Davian took her...

238
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,301

The Anti-God.

They never told you
what was in that canister, did they?

But you always wondered.

245
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,654
Stealing the Rabbit's Foot
was just one event

be his on the train, remember?

Your team's been compromised, Ethan.

265

You're searching for a Russian submarine
vanished on its maiden voyage.

[Benji] The K559 <i>Sevastopol.</i>

A state-of-the-art submarine completely
undetectable to any known sonar.

273
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,696
And the secret to its invisibility
was that.

00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,114
[Luther] The Podkova.

275

Now, in the winter of 2012

278
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,041
the Russians discovered
a computer virus of unknown origin

279

spreading through their Black Sea fleet.

280
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,795
A digital covert operative.

281
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,131
We suspect this mystery virus
was only intended

282
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,926
to sabotage the Podkova,
rendering the submarine detectable.

283
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,887
- Instead...
- It tricked the crew

284
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,764
into sinking themselves.

285
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,016
[Russian officer] Captain!
Our own torpedo is not responding.

<i>where even the Entity can't reach it.</i>

294
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,626
<i>Now, the Podkova's housing was designed
to self-destruct if tampered with.</i>

295
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,461
The only way to safely open it...

296
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,132
is with a specially designed
cruciform key.

00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:55,211
[deep voice] <i>You know what humanity
must do to change their destiny.</i>

487
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,006
<i>You know they cannot stop the inevitable.</i>

488
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,760
<i>They will destroy themselves
believing they have no choice.</i>

489
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,013
<i>Their time has come.</i>

490
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,015
<i>In four days,</i>

491
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,976
<i>they will face their final reckoning.</i>

492
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:16,023
[whirring, electrical zapping]

493
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,692
[suspenseful music playing]

494
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,485
[suspenseful music intensifies]

495
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,669
[no audible dialogue]

496
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,379
[muffled] Is this real? Is this real?

497
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,463
Yeah.

498
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,465
Are you real? You're real.

499
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,842
- You're real.
- Yeah.

500
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,302
[panting]

501
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,139
- It knows.
- [Benji] It knows what?

502
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,433
I need a pen. Something to write on.

503
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,935
You'll take the team.
You'll take them north.

504
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,729
[Benji] North? North where?

505
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,564
- The <i>Sevastopol.</i>
- The <i>Sevastopol?</i>

506
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,650
I have to get caught.
It's the only way I could get there.

507
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,110
VHF receiver. Decompression chamber.

508
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,447
Steal a plane. An old plane.
No transponder, no GPS.

509
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,032
Everything is analog.

510
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,116
A DC-3.

511
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,868
Everything you need is right in there.

512
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,287
Remember to transmit the coordinates
every two hours for 15 minutes

513
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,164
and I'll listen when I can.

514
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,458
- You're team leader now.
- No, I--

515
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,168
Benj, take care of your team.

516
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,127
Key.

517
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,129
- You stay off the ice.
- What ice?

518
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,757
Just please, whatever you do,
no matter what, stay off the ice.

519
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,051
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

520
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,305
Go.

521
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,224
Where are you going?

522
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,309
Luther.

523
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,067
[panting]

524
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,949
[gasping]

525
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,394
- [gate slams]
- [chain rattles]

526
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,238
[Gabriel] Tell Ethan...

527
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,574
I'll be waiting for him.

528
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,561
[beeping]

529
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:34,073
[gasping, panting]

530
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,078
Hey, Luther.

531
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,287
Hey, Ethan.

532
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,664
How'd it go with Gabriel?

533
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,751
Yeah, it went well. We...

534
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,128
You don't say.

535
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,048
And so, whose blood is that?

536
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,341
What?

537
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,594
Oh, it's no one we know.

538
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,055
- Is that what I think it is?
- Nothing special.

539
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,224
Plutonium core.

540
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,477
I'm guessing a five or six megaton yield.

541
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,355
Enough to turn this entire city
into a glass ashtray.

542
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,232
That's...

543
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,650
not good.

544
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,319
[metal clanks]

545
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,530
Already tried. Can't open it.

546
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,657
I see that.

547
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,034
Gabriel has the poison pill.

548
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,577
You might want to find him.

549
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,664
Yeah, we will. Can you disarm that?

550
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:27,209
I just have to stop these nine detonators
from imploding the core.

551
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,504
Detach one detonator, no implosion.

552
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,715
And no implosion, no critical mass.

553
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:38,011
And no critical mass,
no six megaton blast.

554
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,223
- How much time we have?
- Enough time for you to get out of here.

555
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,225
Maybe with those tools
I get these hinges off.

556
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,602
Even if you could get that gate open,

557
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,604
I still have to detach one detonator.

558
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,526
What are you saying?

559
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,071
I can save the city...

560
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,660
but this entire network of tunnels
is going to cave in.

561
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,419
Whoever detaches that detonator...

562
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,883
is going to die.

563
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,510
We're both on the right side of that gate

564
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,013
and you know it.

565
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,515
Luther, throw me the tool bag.

566
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,394
They weren't left here by accident, Ethan.
You know why.

567
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,318
Gabriel needs me alive.

568
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,030
And he needs you to die.

569
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,866
Because you are the only one
who can make another poison pill.

570
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,703
And I am the only one
who can get to that submarine.

571
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,954
[Gabriel] <i>Tell Ethan...</i>

572
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,165
I'll be waiting for him.

573
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,833
[Ethan] <i>If he has the poison pill,</i>

574
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,502
I have to bring him the Podkova

575
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,506
so he can control the Entity.

576
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,425
[gate rattles]

577
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,304
This is where you leave me.

578
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,225
Luther.

579
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,353
[Luther] What are we gonna do?

580
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,063
Retire?

581
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:12,648
Go fishing?

582
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,734
This is my mission.

583
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,154
This is what I was born to do.

584
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,325
Luther, I can't. I can't.

585
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,452
There's nothing you need to say, brother.

586
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,412
I know.

587
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,414
I know.

588
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,167
I'm right where I want to be.

589
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,627
[gate rattles]

590
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,422
Ethan... you need to hurry.

591
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,842
You go.

592
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,804
Find Gabriel.

593
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,431
Stop him.

594
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,016
[gate rattles]

595
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,686
For those we never meet.

596
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,068
[whispers] For those we never meet.

597
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,970
Gabriel, you son of a bitch,

598
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,640
no one is safe from Phineas Phreak.

599
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:06,345
[no audible dialogue]

600
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,443
[Briggs] <i>My man Degas.</i>

601
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,279
Is he dead?

602
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,533
No, he's-- he's alive.

603
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,453
Briggs, isn't it?

604
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,957
But that isn't your real name.

605
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,836
What of it?

606
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,171
Your real name is Jim Phelps.

607
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,715
Like your father.

608
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,554
He was in the service, too.

609
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,974
He vanished when you were seven.

610
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,060
You joined to find out
what happened to him,

611
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,646
and you found out he had legal trouble.

612
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,983
He was offered the choice:

613
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,403
To join the IMF...

614
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,948
or spend the rest of his life in prison.

615
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,242
Just like you, Hunt.

616
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:56,413
Only in your case,
the charge was murder, I believe.

617
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,498
But let me guess.

618
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,542
You were framed.

619
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,087
Just like your claim you were framed
all those years ago in Prague.

620
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,091
<i>How the mission went sideways.</i>

621
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,177
How you lost your whole team.

622
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,763
Your story had my father
down as a traitor.

623
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,516
<i>That's why you killed him.</i>

624
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,191
It's true. I wish it weren't.

625
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,194
You think I'm carrying that?

626
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,197
That I'm here for revenge?

627
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,366
Or... what?

628
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,619
To clear my father's name?

629
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,246
It's my name now.

630
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,248
No.

631
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,211
I'm here

632
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:46,004
because I know you're the reason

633
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,590
the world's staring down the barrel
at Armageddon.

634
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,842
And I also know it's not the first time

635
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,637
you've gambled with
the fate of the human race.

636
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,807
And none of that would matter to me...

637
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,019
if you'd ever once

638
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,604
been following

639
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,314
orders.

640
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,982
Briggs.

641
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:07,817
Phelps.

642
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,028
Jim.

643
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,241
The Entity wants you to hate me.

644
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,159
It's counting on it.

645
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,453
And the only way to beat it
is to do the one thing

646
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:21,164
it would never expect us to do.

647
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,917
What's that?

648
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,845
You forget I know you, Hunt.

649
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,267
I know all your IMF mind games.

650
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,687
When this is over,
when they're done with you,

651

It's a shame about your friend.

Then again,

655

Today at 0400 hours Zulu time,

France's RAMSES facility was breached.

663

Their entire nuclear arsenal is now
under the Entity's command and control.

664
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,860
That leaves only four nations
with secure nuclear arsenals.

The CIA Black Vault break-in.

I'm sorry, what is a "NOC list"?

672
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:19,277
A complete record of our
covert operatives overseas.

673
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:21,946
So this is the man who--

It's on the next page.

00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,294
Am I reading this correctly?
The Kremlin bombing?

679
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:41,716
In fairness, the bomb was
actually meant to kill him.

680
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,803
He gassed a security briefing

[Sidney] That was just two months ago.

You two would have been in that meeting.

684

He arrived in the form
of Mister Kittridge's aide.

And left as Mister Kittridge, I believe.

686
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,407
[Serling] This explains the handcuffs.

687
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,409
It's still not clear why he's here.

688
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,996
Like it or not, what we're looking at
is our means of last resort.

689
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,667
Quite possibly our only hope
of averting nuclear Armageddon.

690
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,128
If we want to control the Entity,

691
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,922
we have to deal with him.

692
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,091

Please sit.

Let's hear it.

698
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,550
I need that key and the use of a ship.

699
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,678
Specifically, an aircraft carrier.

700
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:12,223
More specifically, the <i>George H. W. Bush.</i>

701
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,475
He wants the "use of"

702
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,355
a six-and-a-half billion dollar
nuclear-powered military asset.

703
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:23,985
With instructions for the ship's commander
to accommodate my every request.

704
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,486
To do what exactly?

705
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,449
Use that key and what it opens

706
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,950
to kill the Entity.

707
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,287
Killing the Entity means
the annihilation of cyberspace.

708
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,789
The consequences of which
are catastrophic.

709
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:39,292
Why the hell would I do what you suggest?

710
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,544
Respectfully, Madam President,
you have no other choice.

711
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,047
- There is always another choice.
- No, ma'am.

712
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,215
In this case, not a good one.

713
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:49,928
The world's nuclear powers
are in a paranoid downward spiral.

714
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:53,097
Every nation had a chance
to take their missiles offline,

715
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,559
but no one trusted anyone else to do that.

716
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,144
Your State Department is warning you

717
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,104
that diplomatic channels
are breaking down.

718
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,274
Everyone who still has control of their
arsenals is considering a first strike.

719
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,734
Just like you are.

720
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,194
The intelligence community knows

721
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,695
that the Entity is learning as it goes.

722
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,073
It's getting smarter,
it's getting stronger.

723
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,950
They know that we have only 72 hours

724
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,828
before every other nuclear arsenal
on Earth is under the Entity's control.

725
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:18,873
Three days before it focuses
the full force of its energy

726
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,960
on the toughest, most secure
defense system on the planet: Ours.

727
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:25,588
At which point, the Defense Department
will have no choice but to insist

728
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,048
that you open that case,

729
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,468
enter the codes, and launch
an all-out preemptive strike

730
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,428
on the world's eight
other nuclear arsenals

731
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,305
before the Entity takes control of ours.

732

Madam President,

733
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,184
either you destroy the world
or the Entity does.

734
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,853
In any case, it is checkmate.

[Erika] There is another choice.

736
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,274
You could tell me what
you know about that key

737
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,527
and give us the power
to control the Entity.

738
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,280
Madam President, if I believed that were
true, I would tell you everything I know.

739
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,865
Everything!

740
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,077
You ran the CIA, you know
psychological warfare when you see it.

741
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,746
Just look around.

742
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,374
We are in the Entity's reality.

743
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,085
And I believe it's counting on you
to stop me.

744
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,087
If what you're saying is true,

745
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,172
how can you be sure the Entity
doesn't want us to do

746
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,924
exactly what you're proposing right now?

747
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,759
[Ethan] Because it knows you would
never do anything so illogical.

748
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:14,178
That you would be insane to trust me.

749

And that is precisely why you should.

750
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,348
For once,

751
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,892
let's let the Entity worry
about what we're going to do.

752
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:22,812
I'm worried about those three
other nations, Madam President,

00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,605
still in control of their arsenals.

754
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,317
Nations who could panic
and launch a full-scale attack

carrier, doing God knows what!

While he's out there
trying to kill the Entity.

757
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,410
Which we all know is a terrible idea.

758
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,788
Madam President, please.
I'm asking for three days while you

00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,790
keep the world calm.

760
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,042
Three days.

Have I ever...

00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,170
let you down before?

763
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,464
And when the Entity decides
to attack before then?

764
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,258
It has enough missiles to kill billions
already. Why hasn't it done it?

765
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,135
Because it's a machine.

766
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,471
- It's thinking like a machine.
- No, its thinking...

[NSA representative]
Its thinking is binary.

768

...is dictated by what it's learned from us.

769
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,393
It hasn't launched because
it doesn't have total control.

770
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:07,106
It needs the world's entire atomic arsenal
to guarantee the desired outcome:

The total annihilation of humankind.

[Neely] Did Erika--

818
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,551
Did the President

819
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,636
tell you the meaning behind this note?

820
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,513
No, ma'am.

821
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:54,101
Serbia. May 22nd, 1996.
We both lost someone we loved.

822
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,853
Very much.

823
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,814
All because no one in authority
would take a risk.

824
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,235
I'm sitting on a powder keg, mister.

825
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:09,075
Just over that horizon is Russia's only
aircraft carrier, the <i>Admiral Kuznetsov.</i>

826
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,327
I am one wrong move away
from the first shoot-out

827
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,622
between two flattops since World War II.

828
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:18,376
One flinch from touching off
World War III.

829
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,922
And you're asking me to fly you
directly into the eye of the storm.

830
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:25,466
Yes, ma'am, I am.

831
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,969
What exactly are you looking for?

832
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,721
[Benji] <i>SOSUS.</i>

833
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,349
<i>Short for "Sound Surveillance System."</i>

834
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,518
It's a worldwide network
of undersea acoustic cables

835
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,311
dating back to the Cold War.

836
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,106
If an undersea event of any significance
happens anywhere in the world,

837
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,276
one of these listening stations will
pinpoint that event to the square meter.

838
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,903
[Ethan] <i>And one of these SOSUS stations</i>

839
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,947
will have recorded
our missing Russian submarine's

840
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,449
impact on the sea floor
in the winter of 2012.

841
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,786
Without ever understanding
the significance of the event.

842
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,330
[Benji] Whereas the Russians know
when the <i>Sevastopol</i> vanished.

843
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,249
They're just not exactly sure where.

844
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,959
[In French]

845
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,210
[Benji speaking French]

846
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,920
Which one

847
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:07,091
out of all these SOSUS stations
picked up the event?

848
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,177
We know the bodies of the <i>Sevastopol's</i>
crew were recovered in sea ice.

849
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,930
<i>And since they were recovered
by Inuit fishermen...</i>

850
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,182
We're guessing it went down
somewhere in the Arctic.

851
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:18,686
A search area of roughly
five and a half million square miles.

852
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,189
Meaning the most likely SOSUS
station to pick it up is...

853
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,984
This one. In the Bering Sea.

854
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,444
[Ethan] St. Matthew Island.

855
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,613
The Russians will know this.

856
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,532
Why haven't they just
stormed the island already?

857
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,034
Because St. Matthew is
a U.S. Government installation.

858
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,246
An overt act of aggression
would trigger World War III.

859
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,707
But now Armageddon is coming.

860
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,168
[in French]

861
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,087
Do your friends know they're
walking into a potential siege?

862
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:48,007
They know that's the job.

863
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,260
So, to retrieve the Entity's
source code from <i>Sevastopol,</i>

864
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:54,346
Ethan needs the precise coordinates
from St. Matthew Island.

865
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,557
And a submarine, obviously.

866
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,185
One that's willing to take you
where you want to go.

867
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:00,644
No questions asked.

868
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,062
Ma'am.

869
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,314
And that's assuming

870
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,608
your friends can actually
get the coordinates.

871
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:10,362
Which we're expected to transmit
for fifteen minutes every two hours...

872
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:14,950
In the hope that Ethan is somehow able
to receive our signal.

873
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,786
How do you intend to make it
out from under the ice cap?

874
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,582
After sending me the coordinates,
my team will make their way there.

875
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,751
[Benji] Now, Ethan will
have a VHF transmitter

876
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,129
which will enable us to zero in
on his exact location under the ice.

877
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:29,798
<i>All we have to do then
is grab a chainsaw and--</i>

878
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:33,552
What? Cut a hole in the ice cap
and just pull Ethan out?

879
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:36,138
Hang on. Depending on
how deep that wreck is,

880
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:39,683
Ethan will have severe decompression
sickness before he reaches the surface.

881
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,311
Which is why we have this.

882
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,481
[Grace] What the hell is that?

883
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:50,528
This is a state-of-the-art inflatable
hyperbaric decompression chamber.

884
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,613
You're not serious.

885
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,826
- What?
- You mean to tell me that Ethan's life

886
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,079
and the fate of all life on Earth

887
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:04,500
depends on us all meeting
at the exact same place

888
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,961
at the exact same time,

889
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,506
somewhere in the frozen Bering Sea...

890
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:12,258
with that.

891
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:13,384
[Benji] Exactly.

892
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,886
And what if he drowns before we get there?

893
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,846
In all likelihood, he will.

894
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:22,476
But in water that cold, the hypothermia
will slow down his metabolic functions

895
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,937
<i>and buy us time to revive him.</i>

896
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,148
That's your plan?

897
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:29,942
Exactly.

898
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,528
That's our plan.

899
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:39,368
The only submarine in range is the <i>Ohio.</i>

900
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,287
Jack Bledsoe's boat.

901
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,038
When submerged,

902
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:46,917
he's reachable only by VLF radio--
shielded from any digital transmission.

903
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:50,129
That means he is immune to this thing.

904
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,464
But only if he stays submerged.

905
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,718
An Osprey can get you there in two hours,
but it won't have enough fuel to wait.

906
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,386
There's no other choice.

907
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,598
If Bledsoe receives my command,

908
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,267
if he believes it to be authentic,

909
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,020
he might come to periscope depth.

910
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,480
He might wait thirty seconds.

911
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:11,942
If you are even one minute late...

912
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,153
Just give me this chance.

913
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,690
[NRO representative] <i>You let Hunt go?</i>

- [Serling] With the key?

915
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,446
- He couldn't do much without it.
- So where is he now?

916
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,782
Somewhere in the Northern Pacific,
I assume.

917
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,535
You gave him an aircraft carrier?

918

I am the Commander in Chief
of the Armed Forces, Mister Secretary.

919
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,500
It is my aircraft carrier

920
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,085

I suspected.

923
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:15,923
You could have at least told us.

924
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,258
I just did. And now you're excused.

I couldn't tell you.

It had to be my responsibility
and mine alone.

929
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,368
And I had to buy Hunt time.

930

They may not agree with you,
but they do respect your authority.

I'm sorry, did you say Donloe?

- That's right.
- [Benji] Bill.

The same.

- And you are?
- [chuckles]

I don't believe... Are you ser...

961
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,700
This guy is a coding legend.

962
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:51,411
He designed the CIA mainframe at Langley.
The Black Vault.

963
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,373
It's the most secure database on
the planet. It's completely impenetrable.

964
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,668
Well, if it were impenetrable,
I wouldn't be here.

965
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,212
The Vault was breached in '96

966
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,422
and the agency shipped me
out the same day.

Wait. So you mean to say
you've been on this island for...

Thirty years.

01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,853
Just out of curiosity,
how do you know about the Black Vault?

971
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,564
That's highly classified.

972
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,316
[whispers]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

973
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,527
Sorry. Who did you say you were?

974
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,571
Just tell the man why we're here.

975
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:26,697
Mr. Donloe. Bill.

976
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,407
Even if we could tell you the truth,

977
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,075
you wouldn't believe it. I wouldn't.

978
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,827
The heart of the matter
is that we need access

979
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,621
to all your SOSUS data
from late winter 2012.

980
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,791
Otherwise the world will
cease to exist in a few days.

981
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,253
It's happening, isn't it?

982
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,755
The Entity.

983
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,801
I've tried to warn people
about it for years, but...

984
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,804
no one would listen.

985
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,307
Can you help us?

986
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,601
I wish I could.

987
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,186
[footsteps approaching]

988
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,862
- [dishes clattering]
- [door slams]

989
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:16,246
[Russian soldier] Please come in.

990
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,082
Make yourself comfortable.

991
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,047
[airman 1] Sir! Wake up!

992
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,757
Wake up, sir!

993
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,635
We got problems. Real problems.

994
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:32,763
- What's happening?
- It's the <i>Admiral Kuznetsov.</i>

995
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,224
[airman 1] We got to get out of here!

996
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,602
We're in Ivan's threat zone, man.

997
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,396
- Any sign of the <i>Ohio?</i>
- No, sir. And we're at bingo.

998
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,232
If I don't turn around soon, we won't have
enough fuel to get us back to the boat.

999
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,693
- Anything on the radio?
- Nothing but static on VHF.

1000
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:49,196
If your friends are broadcasting a signal,
we can't hear it.

1001
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,405
Just take us into a hover.

1002
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:52,407
- Sir, we are at bingo.
- Five minutes!

1003
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,618
Just give me five minutes. Please!

1004
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,623
We can give you one.

1005
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,166
Decel.

1006
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,508
What are we doing in a hover?
We got to bug out!

1007
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,884
Bogies at two.

1008
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,429
They're showing us their missiles, man.

1009
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,267
That's the only warning we're gonna get.

1010
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:20,185
Russian Aircraft...

1011
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,604
This is some World War III shit here.
We got to go!

1012
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:24,356
[airman 2] International airspace.
No challenge.

1013
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,650
I repeat: No challenge is intended.

1014
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:31,697
Where the hell are you going?

1015
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,328
[gasps]

1016
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:47,337
[shuddering]

1017
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,851
[shudders]

1018
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,063
[gasping]

1019
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,945
[electricity crackling]

1020
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,178
Where are you, Ethan?

1021
01:07:44,603 --> 01:07:49,107
[shivering, coughing]

1022
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:59,367
[shivers]

1023
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,428
You must be Captain Bledsoe.

1024
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:21,973
And you must be out of your mind.

1025
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:26,103
What exactly was the plan
if we hadn't shown up?

1026
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:29,147
You know, I really hadn't
thought that far ahead.

1027
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,690
Okay.

1028
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,235
Nope.

1029
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:40,325
[Ethan] Rear Admiral Neely
sends her regards.

1030
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,578
She told me to expect a green flare.

1031
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,832
She never mentioned a Taser.

1032
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,042
Mind telling me what this is all about?

1033
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,336
- My mission is classified.
- Uh-huh.

1034
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,088
I need you to take me north.

1035
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,631
Continue.

1036
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,258
I'm expecting a set of exact coordinates

1037
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,093
via Morse code transmission.

1038
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:01,429
And just how exactly do you expect
to receive them down here?

1039
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,765
You'd have to come to periscope depth.

1040
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:05,976
Raise the antenna.

1041
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,270
Signal-scan the low end of the VHF band.

1042
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:11,106
- For how long?
- Fifteen minutes.

1043
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:15,152
That would give the Russians
fifteen minutes to pinpoint our location.

1044
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:19,197
Starting at noon,
and every two hours after that,

1045
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:23,118
until my team sends me those coordinates.

1046
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,582
[Bledsoe] North is the Bering Sea, mister.

1047
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:32,169
Right now every submarine
in the Russian Pacific Fleet is up there.

1048
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,629
My primary mission
is to lock down their positions

1049
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,548
and ascertain what they're up to.

1050
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,383
I'm thinking you know the answer.

1051
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,180
- [Ethan] What is that?
- That's St. Matthew Island.

1052
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,724
There's nothing there
but an old SOSUS listening station.

1053
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,268
No, no, that right next to it.
What is that?

1054
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,940
[Bledsoe] That's the <i>Losharik.</i>

1055
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:55,984
You know what that is?

1056
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,446
It's a mini-sub, Russian Special Forces.

1057
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,281
Get yourself a gold star, mister.

1058
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:05,493
Aerial recon spotted it off
St. Matthew Island just over an hour ago.

1059
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:07,787
It's deployed from this:

1060
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,374
The <i>Belgorod.</i> The deadliest
submarine in the Russian Navy.

1061
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:15,545
My secondary mission is to locate
that bastard and hold it at risk.

1062
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:18,423
The <i>Losharik</i> means
it's somewhere close by.

1063
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,302
You have people on that island.

1064
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,764
That's where your coordinates
are coming from.

1065
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,017
Will you help me?

1066
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,144
Mister...

1067
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,440
if you want to poke the bear,

1068
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,319
oh, you've come to the right man.

1069
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:42,572
Like to speak with your divemaster, sir.

1070
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:44,157
Chief!

1071
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,159
Yes, sir.

1072
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,912
Have Pills meet our guest
in the FORECON quarters.

1073
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,872
[chief] Aye, sir. This way, sir.

1074
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,918
[Donloe] As I've explained
to our friends here,

1075
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,045
I don't have the data they want.

1076
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:01,174
The agency ignored my request
to upgrade our system for a decade.

1077
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,843
One day a team shows up, unannounced,

1078
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,596
<i>and refits the entire system
in a matter of days.</i>

1079
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,473
I'm guessing this is the winter of 2012.

1080
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,101
Right. The old system
ran on magnetic tapes,

1081
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:12,936
backed up to 8-inch floppies.

1082
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,479
<i>These were in the dog shed out back.</i>

1083
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:17,315
These boxes might contain the coordinates

1084
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,025
you're all looking for,

1085
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,486
but I don't have a reader.

1086
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:24,197
That was also taken away in 2012.

1087
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,366
You expect him to build one.

1088
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:29,494
I came for coordinates, not boxes.

1089
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,913
Supposing you find the coordinates.
What happens to my team?

1090
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:35,458
I will take the coordinates to
my superiors. My men wait here.

1091
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,377
When we have located
what we're looking for,

1092
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,422
my men will leave
and you will not be harmed.

1093
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,632
Would you believe that if you were me?

1094
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,884
No, I would not.

1095
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:47,178
You have one hour to build the drive.

1096
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,640
What's your name?

1097
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:51,725
Koltsov.

1098
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,561
- Your first name?
- Captain.

1099
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,439
Koltsov, I'm Grace. That's Benji.

1100
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,899
Could we just, for five minutes,
be human beings?

1101
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:03,611
Not Russians, not Americans, just people
that want to see our loved ones again.

1102
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:06,948
I have no one. Not even a dog.

1103
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:10,160
Well, you certainly don't have this key.

1104
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,830
The cruciform key that grants the holder
access to the Podkova.

1105
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,582
Even if you have the coordinates,

1106
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,001
you still can't safely retrieve
the Entity's source code

1107
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,794
without our help.

1108
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,505
You have another key,

1109
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,050
don't you?

1110
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:27,969
You've had one all along.

1111
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:30,472
What you don't have are the coordinates.

1112
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:34,267
And when you build the drive,

1113
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,353
we will have that.

1114
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:39,230
Okay, let's try something else.

1115
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,649
What if I told you that we have a friend

1116
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:46,112
who's been disavowed by his own government
because he refused to hand over this key?

1117
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,491
Our friend is out there right now,
independent from any chain of command,

1118
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,284
waiting for us
to transmit those coordinates.

1119
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:52,952
And he will stop at nothing

1120
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:56,831
to safely retrieve the Podkova
and use the source code stored on it

1121
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,208
to destroy the Entity.

1122
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,126
And not for the sake of
any one nation, but for all.

1123
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:04,381
Don't you see? The Entity
is counting on us to distrust each other.

1124
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:05,757
Please...

1125
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,009
let us complete our mission.

1126
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,761
We are not enemies.

1127
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:14,307
Would you believe that if you were me?

1128
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,142
[exhales]

1129
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,436
[softly] No.

1130
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:21,731
I suppose I wouldn't.

1131
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:23,608
You have one hour.

1132
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,074
This is the Mark VII pressure suit,

1133
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:33,535
specifically designed
to reduce decompression time

1134
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,412
after diving profound depths.

1135
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:39,666
It does this by means of an exotic mixture
of oxygen and inert gases.

1136
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,419
You'll need to do an extended breathe-up
for your body to handle it.

1137
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,712
Exactly what kind of gases
are we talking about?

1138
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,506
That's classified.

1139
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,050
[Pills] Assuming you're on task
for twenty minutes or less,

1140
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:53,805
your time in decompression
will be cut down from days to hours.

1141
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,933
- Theoretically.
- Theoretically?

1142
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:00,728
We haven't tested the Mark VII
below 300 feet.

1143
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:03,690
[diver 1] To conserve air,
you'll need to make a fast descent.

1144
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,609
Which means guaranteed HPNS.

1145
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:09,487
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.

1146
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,322
You should expect tremors,

1147
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,075
shakes, dizziness,

1148
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,661
disorientation, and mental confusion.

1149
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:20,582
And all of it under extreme pressure.

1150
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:23,793
[Pills] Even if the Mark VII
works as designed,

1151
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:27,046
<i>you still won't have enough mixture
for a slow ascent.</i>

1152
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,632
That means you're guaranteed
to get the bends.

1153
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,053
[Pills] Nitrogen in your muscle tissue
expands into your bloodstream.

1154
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,182
[diver 2] Excruciating pain.

1155
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,559
Convulsions.

1156
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,104
Complete loss of muscle control.

1157
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:47,025
You'll have maybe twenty minutes
to get to the decompression chamber.

1158
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:51,362
- [grunting]
- [divers shouting]

1159
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:53,656
And without the decompression chamber...

1160
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,742
[Pills] You're a dead man.

1161
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,289
[Bledsoe] Another VHF scan came and went.

1162
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,500
If your friends are broadcasting,

1163
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,293
we still haven't picked it up.

1164
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,142
[whirring]

1165
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,603
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1166
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,729
[sighs]

1167
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,316
[dogs barking in the distance]

1168
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:33,780
That's the sled dogs out in the barn.
It's coming up to dinnertime.

1169
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,494
[dogs continue barking]

1170
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,294
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, friend.

1171
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:51,839
There are no coordinates
on any of these disks.

1172
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:55,635
That "refit" fourteen years ago?

1173
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,012
It had all the stench of a cover-up.

1174
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,351
<i>And the top man talked down to Tapeesa.</i>

1175
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,646
<i>I did not like that.</i>

1176
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,357
I never told them about these backups.

1177
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,443
And when they left, I went through
every one of them myself.

1178
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,821
A lone event stood out.

1179
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,155
[deep rumbling]

1180
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,491
<i>A massive undersea implosion</i>

1181
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:20,994
about a month before they arrived
to take everything away.

1182
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:24,455
Naturally, I didn't understand
the significance.

1183
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:27,625
But I noted the coordinates and then

1184
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:29,586
I destroyed the only disk.

1185
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:35,300
[quietly] Are you saying you
know where the <i>Sevastopol</i> is?

1186
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,428
Down to the square meter.

1187
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:45,018
[dogs continue barking]

1188
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:52,150
Dinnertime.

1189
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,864
Can my wife please tend to the dogs?

1190
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,533
I can't concentrate with this racket.

1200
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:11,270
We'll be under the ice cap soon
and lose all comms.

1201
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:15,441
This will be our last chance.

Chief of the Watch, station
the fire control tracking party silently.

1290
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:08,270
- [chief] Silently. Aye, sir.
- Well, that's one mission accomplished.

1291
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:09,939
We found the <i>Belgorod.</i>

1292
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,190
It's right on our ass.

1293
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,026
Wherever your mission is taking you,

1294
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,403
now you're taking the Russians there.

1295
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,616
No, they're never gonna
know my destination.

1296
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,077
When we reach those coordinates,
I'd like you to slow to ten knots,

1297
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,745
turn this boat around

1298
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,832
and take the Russians
back the way we came.

1299
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:29,542
What happens to your mission then?

1300
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,753
I'll be getting off at the turn.

1301
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:35,673
Mister,

1302
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:39,385
without our decompression chamber,
you'll die for sure.

1303
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:44,557
Sir, your decompression chamber
was never part of our plan.

1304
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,311
Oh.

1305
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,521
Okay.

1306
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:55,860
What exactly is your plan?

1307
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:02,741

Of course.

1319
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:54,960
Yeah. Show me.

Wooh.

1326
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:16,732
[Grace] On this? "Wooh" is stop?

1327
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,235
Wooh.

1328
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,279
[Grace] Okay.

1338
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,504

[respirator hisses]

1340
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:25,259
The Mark VII's guidance system
will take you to your coordinates.

1341
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:28,721
The depth at your location is 500 feet.

1342
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,182
Figure 19 minutes to your target,
10 minutes on task.

1343
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:33,434
Remember:

1344
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,935
Any longer than that

1345
01:28:35,019 --> 01:28:38,105
and your chances of survival
decrease by the second.

1346
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:39,690
And don't forget:

1347
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:42,651
You must exhale continuously
as you rise to the surface.

1348
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:45,738
Hold your breath
and your lungs will explode.

1349
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,157
The VHF transmitter you asked for.

1350
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,702
Your team should be able to locate you
within a two-mile radius.

1351
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,120
Look after that.

1352
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,332
Good luck.

1353
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:06,967

the Entity has done?

1457
01:49:40,032 --> 01:49:42,743
If we could control it,

1458
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:48,040
maybe we could bring
the world back from the brink.

1459
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:49,208
Grace...

1460
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:55,256
who on earth would you ever trust
with that much power?

1461
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:57,842
Well, you, of course.

1462
01:49:57,925 --> 01:50:00,511
Only you.

1463
01:50:00,595 --> 01:50:03,764
I believe you were meant to do this.

1464
01:50:04,432 --> 01:50:05,600
Not me.

1465
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:07,518
Not anyone.

1466
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:15,860
Thank you...

1467
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:20,364
for bringing me back.

1468
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,534
Nothing to it.

1469
01:50:25,411 --> 01:50:26,787
[sighs]

1470
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:37,632
It's a long story.

1471
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,014
[airplane roars]

1472
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:10,915
We haven't been formally introduced. I'm--

1473
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:13,250
William Donloe. Langley.

1474
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:16,212
We met thirty years ago.

1475
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:17,755
<i>Almost.</i>

1476
01:51:23,052 --> 01:51:24,512
So you're him.

1477
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,306
I understand I owe you my life.

1478
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:32,269
I don't know how to make amends
for what I've done to yours.

1479
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:35,606
That's a matter of perspective, friend.

1480
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:40,403
If you hadn't broken in the vault
30 years ago, I'd probably still be there.

1481
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:43,114
I'd probably even think I was happy.

1482
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:47,743
I never would have found the only home
that's ever brought me peace.

1483
01:51:47,827 --> 01:51:50,996
And I certainly never would
have met the woman I love.

1484
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,588
There's nothing to be sorry about.

1485
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,301
I owe you my life.

1486
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:17,022
[Benji] We'll be landing
just as the clock runs out.

1487
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:19,024
By the time we arrive,
the Entity will have control

1488
01:52:19,108 --> 01:52:21,652
of the world's nine
automated doomsday arsenals.

1489
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:23,779
And it will be fueling
the missiles it controls.

1490
01:52:23,863 --> 01:52:28,534
But it can't launch until it has a safe
place to hide if it wants to survive.

1491
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:30,411
The safest place is here.

1492
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:33,581
- What is that?
- The Doomsday Vault. Kongo Yowa.

1493
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:37,168
[Donloe] It's a top secret
standalone, solar-powered,

1494
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,086
<i>TEMPEST-hardened, Level A</i>

1495
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:40,963
exabyte data server.

1496
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:43,048
One billion gigabytes of storage.

1497
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:45,593
- That's a lot of home movies.
- [Donloe] Well, you're not far off.

1498
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:48,888
It contains all the accumulated knowledge
deemed worthy of preservation.

1499
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:50,598
And it's fully shielded.

1500
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:53,017
[Benji] <i>Totally impervious
to electromagnetic energy of any kind.</i>

1501
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,518
<i>No transmissions in or out.</i>

1502
01:52:54,602 --> 01:52:56,645
[Donloe] <i>An incorruptible
ark of human history</i>

1503
01:52:56,729 --> 01:52:58,564
built to survive the end of the world.

1504
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:00,816
So, if the Entity got in there,

1505
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,194
it could survive for thousands of years,

1506
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:04,904
no matter what happened
to the rest of the world.

1507
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,572
[Degas] And why would it want to survive?

1508
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:09,533
What does it stand to gain
from wiping out all life on Earth?

1509
01:53:09,617 --> 01:53:13,662
A question Noah and his family
must have asked just before the flood.

1510
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:15,831
[Benji] The Anti-God thinks it's God.

1511
01:53:15,915 --> 01:53:17,291
[in French]

1512
01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:18,834
Always

1513
01:53:18,918 --> 01:53:20,294
right to the point, aren't you?

1514
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:24,590
This is the poison pill
containing Luther's algorithm.

1515
01:53:25,925 --> 01:53:27,593
And this is the Podkova,

1516
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:29,804
containing the Entity's
original source code.

1517
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:33,557
When combined,
they will form a sort of digital toxin.

1518
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:36,435
When uploaded to cyberspace,
this toxin will attack the Entity

1519
01:53:36,519 --> 01:53:39,104
and alter its ability to perceive reality.

1520
01:53:39,188 --> 01:53:41,982
So, combine that with the Podkova...

1521
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:44,610
We can deceive the Lord of Lies.

1522
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:48,739
[in French]

1523
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:50,032
<i>Mais...</i>

1524
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:51,659
we don't have Luther's poison pill.

1525
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:53,536
Gabriel does.

1526
01:53:53,619 --> 01:53:56,747
Which is why we can be sure he'll be
waiting for us in the Doomsday Vault.

1527
01:53:56,831 --> 01:53:59,959
[Benji] Once the Entity is infected
with Luther's algorithm,

1528
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:02,670
it will think it's entering
the junction's central data server

1529
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:05,923
when it will actually be going here.

1530
01:54:06,006 --> 01:54:07,591
What is it?

1531
01:54:07,675 --> 01:54:09,218
[Benji] Careful, it's very delicate.

1532
01:54:09,802 --> 01:54:11,387
It can't be.

1533
01:54:12,555 --> 01:54:15,266
It's a 5D optical data drive.

1534
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:17,726
360 terabytes in the palm of your hand.

1535
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,728
[Donloe] I thought these
were just theoretical.

1536
01:54:19,812 --> 01:54:20,855
[Ethan] They were.

1537
01:54:20,938 --> 01:54:22,731
Until Luther built one.

1538
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:30,281
If the Entity is our genie,

1539
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:34,326
then this optical drive
is the bottle we'll capture it in.

1540
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:36,203
Which brings us to the tricky part.

1541
01:54:36,287 --> 01:54:38,205
Once inside,

1542
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:40,082
once it believes that it's safe,

1543
01:54:40,165 --> 01:54:42,918
the Entity will initiate a nuclear launch.

1544
01:54:43,002 --> 01:54:45,838
We have to disconnect this drive
before it can do that.

1545
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,047
How long do we have?

1546
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:48,924
Roughly...

1547
01:54:49,008 --> 01:54:50,509
[both] 100 milliseconds.

1548
01:54:50,593 --> 01:54:52,386
The blink of an eye.

1549
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,430
[Benji] If we do it too soon...

1550
01:54:54,513 --> 01:54:56,265
We won't trap the genie in the bottle.

1551
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:58,183
Mmm. And if we do it too late...

1552
01:54:58,267 --> 01:55:00,603
We won't prevent the Entity
from launching.

1553
01:55:00,686 --> 01:55:02,146
Either way...

1554
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:04,064
[Donloe] <i>If we pull the drive
at the wrong time,</i>

1555
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:05,774
the Entity wins.

1556
01:55:05,858 --> 01:55:07,484
[in French]

1557
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:10,738
Hang on. If the Doomsday Vault
is electronically shielded,

1558
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:12,406
how does the Entity expect to get in?

1559
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:15,200
It expects us to let it in.

1560
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:18,454
Just like Gabriel expects me
to hand over the Podkova.

1561
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:20,915
Neither of which we'd ever do, obviously.

1562
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:23,250
Right?

1563
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:25,920
Think about it.
The vault is electronically shielded.

1564
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:28,505
No signals get in or out.

1565
01:55:28,589 --> 01:55:31,216
Someone has to go outside the vault

1566
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:35,429
in order to upload Luther's
poison pill to the Entity.

1567
01:55:35,512 --> 01:55:37,806
And if Gabriel wants
to control the Entity...

1568
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:42,853
He has to upload Luther's poison pill.

1569
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:47,566
You're not seriously
gonna give him the Podkova

1570
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:49,443
and let him get away with the pill.

1571
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:52,363
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

1572
01:55:52,446 --> 01:55:55,741
<i>Gabriel will be part of
the team and never know it.</i>

1573
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,953
That's insane!
You're letting the Entity into the vault.

1574
01:55:59,036 --> 01:56:01,121
That's precisely what it wants you to do.

1575
01:56:01,205 --> 01:56:03,624
"It is written."

1576
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:04,708
[Ethan] Yes.

1577
01:56:04,792 --> 01:56:06,877
And it's the only chance we have

1578
01:56:06,961 --> 01:56:08,253
of beating Gabriel and the Entity.

1579
01:56:08,337 --> 01:56:09,672
One chance in a trillion.

1580
01:56:09,755 --> 01:56:11,924
Ethan, think about what you're doing.

1581
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:15,594
Think about how you got here.
Think about how the world got here.

1582
01:56:15,678 --> 01:56:19,264
How do you know that the Entity
didn't want you to recover the Podkova?

1583
01:56:19,348 --> 01:56:20,975
Maybe it told you it was impossible

1584
01:56:21,058 --> 01:56:23,686
because it knew that was the thing
that you needed to hear!

1585
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:26,730
[whispers] Is that what you think, Grace?

1586
01:56:26,814 --> 01:56:29,900
I think you're risking
the fate of the world

1587
01:56:29,984 --> 01:56:32,319
and billions of lives

1588
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:34,071
on the blink of an eye.

1589
01:56:34,154 --> 01:56:35,572
[Ethan whispering] Yes, Grace.

1590
01:56:35,656 --> 01:56:36,907
I am.

1591
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:41,245
And if there was another choice,
I'd take it.

1592
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:45,666
I know you all have your doubts.
I don't blame you.

1593
01:56:45,749 --> 01:56:47,793
But we have to stick together.

1594
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:50,379
And we have to make sure that Grace

1595
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:53,298
is the one to disconnect that drive.

1596
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:55,175
Me?

1597
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:59,388
What separates a good pickpocket
from a great one?

1598
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:01,432
[sighs]

1599
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,727
Timing.

1600
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:07,187
Blink of an eye.

1601
01:57:38,927 --> 01:57:40,804
[Benji] <i>Where is everybody?</i>

1602
01:57:40,888 --> 01:57:42,639
They know what's coming.

1603
01:57:43,849 --> 01:57:45,559
They've all gone home.

1604
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:51,899
[gun clicks]

1605
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:56,505
[Angstrom] We can't accurately predict
how fast the Entity is moving now.

1606
01:58:56,588 --> 01:58:59,133
Madam President, Hunt is gone.

1607
01:58:59,216 --> 01:59:01,593
If he isn't dead, the Russians have him.

1608
01:59:01,677 --> 01:59:03,720
If we lose control of our arsenal,

1609
01:59:03,804 --> 01:59:06,348
we lose any hope of preventing
the Entity from launching.

1610
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,183
We are out of time!

1611
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:13,605
General Sidney...

1612
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:17,401
what is our most limited attack option?

1613
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:19,236
[Sidney] Surgical nuclear strikes

1614
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:22,406
confined strictly to the command centers
of the eight nations

1615
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:24,116
under the Entity's control.

1616
01:59:24,199 --> 01:59:27,161
Beijing. Islamabad. London.

1617
01:59:27,953 --> 01:59:31,290
Moscow. New Delhi. Paris.

1618
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:34,001
Pyongyang. And Tel Aviv.

1619
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:35,878
Casualties.

1620
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:39,089
Estimated death tolls
from initial strikes.

1621
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:45,762
And more later, of course,
from the resulting nuclear fallout.

1622
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:49,057
Estimates, uh... vary.

1623
01:59:49,141 --> 01:59:53,228
Obviously the bombing of major cities
in eight different countries

1624
01:59:53,312 --> 01:59:56,148
would create
an unprecedented political crisis.

1625
01:59:56,231 --> 02:00:00,611
One that would likely lead
to a protracted global war.

1626
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:04,323
It may be diplomatically prudent
to make a...

1627
02:00:06,325 --> 02:00:07,326
gesture.

1628
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:11,163
A gesture?

1629
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:14,082
Sacrifice one of our cities here at home.

1630
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,628
We've prepared a list.

1631
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:24,009
[Angstrom] Cities have been arranged
by strategic and economic importance.

1632
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:26,386
And... [clears throat]

1633
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:27,971
...population, of course.

1634
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:31,558
You'd be sacrificing
a hundred million lives...

1635
02:00:32,476 --> 02:00:34,436
to save seven billion.

1636
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:38,065
This can't be happening.

1637
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:39,274
[Sidney] Madam President,

1638
02:00:39,358 --> 02:00:42,319
we are in the Entity's reality now.

1639
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:45,656
And this is checkmate.

1640
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:52,913
[stomps]

1641
02:01:02,506 --> 02:01:05,342
Gunnery Sergeant, I need your sidearm.

1642
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:07,886
Sir?

1643
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:10,764
You heard me, son. Hand it over.

1644
02:01:25,696 --> 02:01:27,864
The main server's through there.

1645
02:01:27,948 --> 02:01:31,201
Now, Benji, Grace, you come with me.

1646
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:33,078
The rest of you, you just wait here.

1647
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:34,246
<i>Non.</i>

1648
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:35,622
[in French]

1649
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:43,547
[speaks French]

1650
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,634
[footsteps splashing]

1651
02:02:04,192 --> 02:02:06,361
That's the door to the server room.

1652
02:02:06,445 --> 02:02:08,363
It's too exposed.

1653
02:02:08,447 --> 02:02:10,449
You should go back to the others.

1654
02:02:10,532 --> 02:02:13,535
If Gabriel is in there, he'll kill you.

1655
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:16,580
He has to leave here
with the pill and the Podkova.

1656
02:02:17,706 --> 02:02:20,667
I'm expendable. Neither of you are.

1657
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:22,669
He's right.

1658
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,431
Take care of your team.

1659
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:24,523
[Gabriel] Your final reckoning!

1660
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:45,961
Thirty megaton yield.

1661
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:50,257
My man lets go of that button
and the Entity has no place to hide.

1662
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,300
And what happens to you?

1663
02:03:52,384 --> 02:03:56,221
I have a plane that'll take me
to minimum safe distance.

1664
02:03:56,304 --> 02:04:00,142
Reliable, analog, under the radar.

1665
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:03,395
I even brought a spare. Just in case.

1666
02:04:03,478 --> 02:04:05,939
And you honestly believe
destroying this place

1667
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:07,607
will stop the Entity from launching.

1668
02:04:07,691 --> 02:04:09,234
I think it's bluffing.

1669
02:04:09,317 --> 02:04:11,153
It won't end the world
if it can't survive,

1670
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:13,363
and it can't survive
if you don't let it in.

1671
02:04:13,447 --> 02:04:15,449
Now hand over the Podkova

1672
02:04:15,532 --> 02:04:17,117
and I'll let you walk away.

1673
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,412
- Why would I believe that?
- Because I want you

1674
02:04:20,495 --> 02:04:22,914
and everyone you care about

1675
02:04:22,998 --> 02:04:26,209
to live long lives in the world I create

1676
02:04:26,293 --> 02:04:28,712
when the Entity answers to me.

1677
02:04:28,795 --> 02:04:30,380
You're beat, Ethan.

1678
02:04:30,464 --> 02:04:34,217
If not today, some other place,
some other time.

1679
02:04:35,302 --> 02:04:37,512
As long as I have this,

1680
02:04:37,596 --> 02:04:40,682
wherever I go, you will follow.

1681
02:04:40,765 --> 02:04:43,393
And the Podkova will come to me.

1682
02:04:43,477 --> 02:04:45,353
That is written.

1683
02:04:45,437 --> 02:04:47,606
Nothing is written.

1684
02:04:47,689 --> 02:04:50,108
I'm not sure Luther would agree.

1685
02:04:52,694 --> 02:04:54,029
Now,

1686
02:04:54,112 --> 02:04:56,490
tell me I win!

1687
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:07,792
You win.

1688
02:05:07,876 --> 02:05:10,003
I like the sound of that.

1689
02:05:10,545 --> 02:05:12,130
Say it again.

1690
02:05:12,214 --> 02:05:13,173
Uh-uh.

1691
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:14,674
Oh, no.

1692
02:05:14,758 --> 02:05:16,843
Hands where I can see them, dickhead.

1693
02:05:19,888 --> 02:05:21,306
[sighs]

1694
02:05:49,668 --> 02:05:51,253
Let's have it.

1695
02:05:51,336 --> 02:05:52,462
Time?

1696
02:05:52,546 --> 02:05:54,297
18 minutes.

1697
02:05:55,215 --> 02:05:56,341
[sighs]

1698
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,844
I know you.

1699
02:05:59,928 --> 02:06:01,304
Donloe.

1700
02:06:01,388 --> 02:06:02,764
William Donloe.

1701
02:06:02,847 --> 02:06:04,849
My wife, Tapeesa.

1702
02:06:04,933 --> 02:06:08,937
I got to hand it to you, Hunt. This is
one crackerjack unit you've put together.

1703
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:13,275
I'm imagining the Entity is shaking
in its virtual shorts right about now.

1704
02:06:13,358 --> 02:06:17,320
What do I need to know about this,
and what exactly was the play?

1705
02:06:17,404 --> 02:06:20,615
The only play is to give that to him,
and let him go right now.

1706
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:23,285
You want me to give this
to him and let him go.

1707
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:24,828
- [Ethan] Right now.
- [Kittridge] Right now.

1708
02:06:24,911 --> 02:06:27,038
- Right now.
- Right now...

1709
02:06:27,122 --> 02:06:29,040
the President of the United States

1710
02:06:29,124 --> 02:06:31,876
is preparing to vaporize millions
upon millions of souls.

1711
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:37,465
All because Ethan here doesn't believe
that anyone can safely control the Entity.

1712
02:06:37,549 --> 02:06:40,385
Does that sound sane? To anyone?

1713
02:06:40,468 --> 02:06:43,388
Maybe you should ask
the crew of the <i>Sevastopol.</i>

1714
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:47,684
- Time?
- 17 minutes, sir.

1715
02:06:47,767 --> 02:06:48,602
Kittridge.

1716
02:06:48,685 --> 02:06:50,979
You wouldn't be here
if Ethan didn't have a plan.

1717
02:06:51,062 --> 02:06:53,523
Whomever tells me what that plan is

1718
02:06:53,607 --> 02:06:57,402
will be sparing millions of lives, and
you'll be spared the fate of the others.

1719
02:06:57,485 --> 02:06:59,863
Sir, we're running out of time.
We need to get to a minimum safe distance.

1720
02:06:59,946 --> 02:07:01,031
Why are we still standing here?

1721
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:04,117
Because he's here and he's here.

1722
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,578
And this means something.

1723
02:07:07,329 --> 02:07:08,872
Any second now

1724
02:07:08,955 --> 02:07:11,791
Ethan's gonna tell me what it is.

1725
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:14,461
I've known this man for a long time.

1726
02:07:14,544 --> 02:07:19,883
And he won't want anything to happen
to his precious team.

1727
02:07:24,304 --> 02:07:26,264
And that's the pattern, isn't it?

1728
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:29,976
You refuse to sacrifice

1729
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,562
the ones you hold close.

1730
02:07:34,856 --> 02:07:37,192
That is why we're still here.

1731
02:07:38,193 --> 02:07:39,611
It's over.

1732
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:41,279
There's no shame in it.

1733
02:07:41,863 --> 02:07:42,822
Now just...

1734
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,367
tell me what I'm missing.

Catch me if you can, Ethan!

1746
02:08:39,421 --> 02:08:41,214
You go after him and get the pill.

1747
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,174
We'll get to the server room
and let the Entity in.

Ethan, we'll figure it out.

1750
02:08:48,972 --> 02:08:51,683
You are forgetting the bomb.
The nuclear bomb.

1751
02:08:51,766 --> 02:08:53,518
We'll figure it out.

- Benji.

Go! I got this.

1754
02:08:56,396 --> 02:08:57,397
Go.

We got to go, Briggs.

- It's your funeral.
- Let's go.

There has to be a way to disarm it.

1769
02:11:59,996 --> 02:12:01,623
Even if you can prevent it
from going nuclear,

1770
02:12:01,706 --> 02:12:03,875
you can't stop those detonators
from exploding.

1771
02:12:03,958 --> 02:12:05,668
Could we survive the blast
from the server room?

1772
02:12:05,752 --> 02:12:08,922
Only if someone stays behind
and stops the bomb from going critical.

1773
02:12:09,005 --> 02:12:12,842
But whoever that is,
they're not going to make it.

02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:23,686
We'll handle the bomb. The rest of you
get Benji to the server room.

1776
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:26,314
There's no time to discuss it. Go.

[Grace] I've got it. I've got it.

1781
02:12:36,824 --> 02:12:38,201
I'll stay with them.

1782
02:12:38,284 --> 02:12:41,412
There's nothing for me
to do in the server room.

1783
02:12:41,996 --> 02:12:43,289
Good luck.

1784
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:45,625
Good luck.

Where'd you learn to do this?

02:14:16,466 --> 02:14:18,384
Never said I did.

- This is not good.
- What is it?

1793
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,866
If I had to guess,
it's a tension pneumothorax.

1794
02:14:41,949 --> 02:14:43,326
What does that mean?

1795
02:14:43,409 --> 02:14:45,453
Pressure building
in the pleural cavity. [gasps]

1796
02:14:45,536 --> 02:14:47,080
My lung is collapsing.

1797
02:14:47,163 --> 02:14:51,084
If we don't act fast, it means
suffocation or cardiac arrest.

1798
02:14:51,167 --> 02:14:53,711
Do either of you have
any medical experience?

[in French]

1800
02:14:57,298 --> 02:14:58,633
I can work with that.

1801
02:14:58,716 --> 02:15:00,510
[gasping] Grace, I need
you to hack the server

1802
02:15:00,593 --> 02:15:02,303
so we can let the Entity in.

1803

- [Benji speaking French]

- Open the panel.

Uh, everything's under control here.

1835

Okay, hold this very steady.

- Hang on.
- What? What is it?

1844
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:58,622
We may have a way out of this.

1845
02:18:58,706 --> 02:19:01,417
These ground wires are triple redundant.

1846
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:03,794
If we cut any three
of them simultaneously,

1847
02:19:03,878 --> 02:19:06,464
we could delay these detonators
from exploding.

1848
02:19:06,547 --> 02:19:08,883
Maybe long enough for someone
to make it to the server room.

1849
02:19:08,966 --> 02:19:10,384
How long?

1850
02:19:11,385 --> 02:19:13,179
Ten seconds. Maybe.

1851
02:19:14,472 --> 02:19:16,891
You think you can make it
to that door in ten seconds?

1852
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:22,229
Only one way to find out.
Hand me the ratchet.

1853
02:19:22,313 --> 02:19:25,608
- Okay, I'm in. What now?
- [Benji] We're not out of the woods yet.

1854
02:19:25,691 --> 02:19:27,693
Any minute now, my blood pressure's
gonna drop drastically

1855
02:19:27,777 --> 02:19:30,863
and I'll grow faint,
so we need to work fast.

1856
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:34,408
There's a receiver in the tool bag.
Asilver box with two lights on it.

1857
02:19:34,492 --> 02:19:35,785
Got it.

1858
02:19:35,868 --> 02:19:37,495
We need to splice that
into the server's solar panels

1859
02:19:37,578 --> 02:19:38,537
and make an antenna.

1860
02:19:38,621 --> 02:19:39,747
That way we'll know

1861
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:41,290
when Ethan's uploading the poison pill.

1862
02:19:41,374 --> 02:19:43,751
- Yep. Got it.
- Now this is the really tricky part.

1863
02:19:43,834 --> 02:19:46,295
There is a bundle
of blue, black, and red cables

1864
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:48,214
in the lower right corner.

1865
02:19:48,297 --> 02:19:50,091
All right. Walk me through it.

1866
02:19:50,174 --> 02:19:53,010
I'm gonna need you to cut
two of the wires in a specific order,

1867
02:19:53,094 --> 02:19:57,098
but whatever you do, do not cut...

1868
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,727
- Benji!
- [grunts]...the red ones.

1869

[Serling] Madam President,
as your Secretary of Defense

1870
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:10,486
I direct your attention to CONPLAN 8044,

1871
02:20:10,569 --> 02:20:13,239
selected Attack Option 9.1.

1872
02:20:13,322 --> 02:20:15,991
A targeted nuclear strike
on the command centers

1873
02:20:16,075 --> 02:20:19,078
of all eight nations
now controlled by the Entity.

1874
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:23,874
Amended to include the American city
you've chosen to sacrifice.

1875
02:20:25,334 --> 02:20:26,419
The Biscuit.

1876
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:41,809
Have you spoken to your son?

1877
02:20:43,477 --> 02:20:45,479
What would I tell him?

1878
02:20:45,563 --> 02:20:47,648
[Serling] Authentication code verified.

1879
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:53,446
Come on!

1880
02:21:04,874 --> 02:21:06,417
Come on, Ethan.

1881
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:07,918
<i>Know when you're beat.</i>

1882
02:21:08,002 --> 02:21:10,504
<i>Any minute now your team will be dead.</i>

1883
02:21:10,588 --> 02:21:13,757
<i>And the Entity will have no place to hide.</i>

1884
02:21:23,517 --> 02:21:24,560
[rattling]

1885
02:21:27,813 --> 02:21:29,899
[Gabriel]
<i>I'm gonna run you into the ground.</i>

1886
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:32,526
<i>The Podkova will be mine</i>

1887
02:21:32,610 --> 02:21:34,695
<i>and the Entity will answer to me.</i>

1888
02:21:35,446 --> 02:21:37,364
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

1889
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:40,826
- [Grace] Ow.
- [Degas] <i>Grace, we think</i>

1890
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:42,244
we can prevent this bomb
from going nuclear,

1891
02:21:42,328 --> 02:21:43,579
but all of these detonators will explode.

1892
02:21:43,662 --> 02:21:44,705
How big a blast?

1893
02:21:45,664 --> 02:21:47,208
How big a blast are we talking?

1894
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:50,503
- [Degas] <i>Big.</i>
- [grunts]

1895
02:21:50,586 --> 02:21:52,338
Ethan needs all the time we can give him.

1896
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:54,798
Do not make the last cut
until we absolutely have to.

1897
02:22:01,013 --> 02:22:02,014
Madam President,

1898
02:22:02,723 --> 02:22:04,892
launch is now enabled.

1899

[breathing shakily]

1900
02:22:33,587 --> 02:22:35,130
What are you doing?

1901
02:22:35,214 --> 02:22:38,259
What we should have done
in the first place.

1902
02:22:38,342 --> 02:22:42,972
Order U.S. Strategic Command
Center to cut their power.

1903
02:22:43,055 --> 02:22:45,391
Take our missiles offline entirely.

1904
02:22:46,392 --> 02:22:48,018
Shut everything down.

1905
02:22:48,102 --> 02:22:51,772
Madam President, that would
leave the country completely defenseless.

1906
02:22:51,855 --> 02:22:56,402
But deny the Entity access
to the largest nuclear arsenal on Earth.

1907
02:22:56,485 --> 02:22:57,861
Now, make the call.

1908
02:22:57,945 --> 02:22:58,946
Oh, thank God.

1909
02:22:59,029 --> 02:23:00,990
Ma'am, we are the only nation on Earth

1910
02:23:01,073 --> 02:23:02,950
with the power to attack the Entity!

1911
02:23:03,033 --> 02:23:05,786
And now we're the only nation
in the world with the power of choice.

1912
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:08,038
Today I choose not to attack.

1913
02:23:08,122 --> 02:23:09,748
Madam President, think this through.

1914
02:23:09,832 --> 02:23:11,792
You are making a terrible mistake!

1915
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:14,128
For the sake of the country,
please listen to reason.

1916
02:23:14,211 --> 02:23:15,546
That's precisely what I'm doing.

1917
02:23:15,629 --> 02:23:17,631
Connect me with Strategic Command HQ.

1918
02:23:17,715 --> 02:23:20,384
[Serling] Millions of people will die,
ma'am, if you don't push that button.

1919
02:23:20,467 --> 02:23:22,261
[Walters] And millions of other people
will die if she does!

1920
02:23:22,344 --> 02:23:24,221
What give us the right to decide
who lives and who dies?

1921
02:23:24,305 --> 02:23:26,390
[Serling] She took an oath
as President of the United States.

1922
02:23:26,473 --> 02:23:29,059
Twenty minutes after we launch,
none of that will matter!

1923
02:23:29,143 --> 02:23:30,894
I'm inclined to agree with the President.

1924
02:23:30,978 --> 02:23:34,189
While we stand here arguing,
the Entity is preparing to attack, ma'am!

1925
02:23:34,273 --> 02:23:38,277
You may choose to live in the Entity's
reality, gentlemen. I don't.

1926
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,820
Hold for the President.

1927
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:41,780
General Overton's office,
Strategic Command.

1928
02:23:41,864 --> 02:23:45,951
General Overton, this is the President
calling with an unorthodox command.

1929
02:23:46,035 --> 02:23:48,704
I need you to listen to my instructions
very carefully

1930
02:23:48,787 --> 02:23:51,165
and follow them to the letter
without hesitation.
