be okay. Alright.

Can you squeeze
my fingers?

Squeeze. Squeeze.
Squeeze them harder.

Great. Can you move
your toes?

- Um...
- Lift up your feet.

- Good. Good. Okay.

Can you grab me the water
bottle from the car? Thanks.

Hey, this one's got
New York plates.

659
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,866
Weren't... Weren't Sara and
Nathan from New York?

660
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:08,694
Uh, they were
Boston, I think.

661
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,913
Boston. Right. Okay.

662
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:12,001
Did you take anything?

663

What?

- Are you nauseous or anything?
- No, no. Where's Tobey?

You should get down there.
Looks pretty bad.

Okay. Um, here. Make sure
that he doesn't hurt himself,

670
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,372
and plenty of water, okay?

671
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:39,202
Right. Hey, it's
gonna be okay. Drink.

Oh, my God.
You're all so beautiful.

you feeling?

Uh...

00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,592
Where's the doctor?

677
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:23,464
She had to go.

678
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:25,945
But it's okay.

679
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,034
You're safe now.

Everything's going
to be alright.

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,785
You just rest.

[Ominous music plays]

00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,149
[Grunting] Okay.
Make sure you lift her up.

Are you okay?

- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You're okay?

Yes. Yes.

Where's... where's Daddy?

- Where's Ethan?
- They're still in the RV.

Okay. Well, good news is
that he's stable.

- Yeah.
- His airway's clear, his pulses

are strong, and there's no
obvious damage to the artery.

712

- Bad news?
- I mean, there's a table leg

through his thigh. We can't
exactly just yank him...

How much time you
need to do it right?

715

of daylight left, so...

trust these people.

803
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,644
There's something
really weird. I don't...

804
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,646
What does it mean,
"The woods aren't safe"?

805
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:05,823
What is that? What?
The woods aren't safe?

806
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:08,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know this is, uh...

807
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:09,652
But we gotta go.

808
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:10,566
Like, right now.

809
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:14,092
- Jim, I can't go.
- [Kenny] Right now.

810
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,224
Like, we gotta go. Come on.
Let's go.

811
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:23,362
- [Grunting]
- Okay.

812
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:25,494
So, we have to separate
the table leg from the table,

813
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,583
and it's gonna be dark out, so
do you have any lanterns

814
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,063
or lights or anything like that?

815
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:30,412
[Jim] Yeah. Uh, got, uh...

816
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,588
- I got lamps.
- [Kristi] Great.

817
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,201
Uh, got lanterns.

818
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:42,511
Perfect.

819
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,151
- Got it.
- Okay.

820
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:14,761
- How we doing in here?
- Uh, good.

821
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,893
Uh, we're almost
ready to go.

822
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,198
- [Boyd] Yeah.
- [Kristi] Okay, Jim.

823
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,679
I'm gonna need you around
here, just to support

824
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,550
- the head and neck, okay?
- Okay.

825
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,860
[Boyd] Hey, Jim? Would you grab
me that blanket right there?

826
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:28,601
Right by your... by your left
foot. Right there.

827
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:29,558
- Yup.
- Thanks.

828
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:46,706
What are you doing?

829
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:51,145
I am, uh...

830
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:55,236
doing my best
to keep the RV safe.

831

[Tires pop]

832

Shit! Shit! Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

833
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:21,915
You left the fucking
spike strip down!

834
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:24,439
It's okay. It's okay.
We can make it to Colony House.

835
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,919
That's if they open the door
for us.

836
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,703
They'll open the door!
Alright? Come on.

837
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,357
- [Father] Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

838
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:31,925
It's very important that we get
inside as soon as possible,

839
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:34,449
so that means that... that means
that you run as fast as you can.

840
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,538
No matter what you see,
no matter what you hear,

841
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,540
you do not stop. You understand
me? No matter what.

842
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,585
- Go, go, go.
- [Kenny] Come on!

843

[Rain falling]

844
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,595
What do you mean,
"make the RV safe"?

845
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,510
What?

846
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,467
Safe from what?

847
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:57,951
Jim... there are things you
need to understand

848
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,126
about what
happens next.

849
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:01,172
[Ethan] Dad?

850
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:04,305
Ah. Hi, honey.

851
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:05,567
It hurts.

852
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:08,788
- [Jim] I know.
- Okay. Okay. He's awake.

853
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,442
We're gonna take
care of you, though.

854
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:11,660
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

855
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:15,882
Shit. Hold his neck. Great.

856
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,927
- Ethan. Ethan. Ethan.
- [Kristi] Good, good...

857
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,755
We just gotta support the airway
like that. Good. Yeah.

858
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:21,192
Oh, come on.

859
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,368
[Kristi] Use your forearms
a little bit more.

860
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:24,456
- Kristi?
- We're fine.

861
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:25,761
Just keep
covering the windows.

862
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,459
Jim, I need you
right under his neck, okay?

863
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,418
Use your forearms to get right
under his head, just like that.

864
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,594
- [Jim] Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.
- Yeah. You're doing great.

865
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:33,595
Good, good, good, good.
